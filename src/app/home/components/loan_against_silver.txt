LOAN AGAINST SILVER
India's Next Frontier in Secured Lending


STRATEGIC RESEARCH REPORT


Prepared for:
India-Based Global NBFC


February 2026  |  Confidential & Proprietary
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Reserve Bank of India's landmark 'Lending Against Gold and Silver Collateral Directions, 2025,' effective April 1, 2026, marks a watershed moment in India's formal credit landscape. For the first time in India's financial history, silver — the country's second most culturally embedded precious metal — has been granted full regulatory recognition as eligible loan collateral under a structured, supervised framework. This report provides a comprehensive strategic assessment of the Loan Against Silver (LAS) opportunity for India-based global NBFCs preparing to enter and capture this nascent but substantial market.

33,000T
Silver Held by Indian Households	₹1.45L Cr
Projected Gold+Silver Loan Market by 2028	85%
Max LTV for Loans up to ₹2.5L	Apr 1, 2026
RBI Regulatory Effective Date

Strategic Rationale
India is home to an estimated 33,000 tonnes of silver — approximately 29,000 tonnes in jewellery and 4,000 tonnes in coins — accumulated over decades and held predominantly in rural and semi-urban households. Until June 2025, this vast reservoir of household wealth was classified as 'dead capital' by the formal banking system. With the RBI's new Directions, every commercial bank, NBFC, co-operative bank, and housing finance company (excluding payments banks) is now empowered to extend credit against this asset class, ushering in what analysts are calling India's 'Silver Revolution' in finance.
For an India-based global NBFC, the Loan Against Silver presents a rare combination of first-mover advantage, rural market penetration potential, and portfolio diversification within a regulated framework. The product mirrors the highly successful Gold Loan model — an asset class that grew at a 25% CAGR from FY2020 to FY2024 — but operates in a significantly underserved and less competitive segment.

Key Findings
•	The RBI's Directions, 2025 formalize silver-backed lending with LTV tiers of 85% (loans up to ₹2.5L), 80% (₹2.5L–₹5L), and 75% (above ₹5L), providing a clear commercial framework for product development.
•	Eligible collateral is restricted to silver jewellery/ornaments (up to 10 kg per borrower) and silver coins (up to 500 g), ensuring consumer protection and preventing speculative hoarding.
•	India holds an estimated 65,000 tonnes of silver in household possession per some surveys, with most lying idle; even 1–2% monetization could create a multi-thousand crore lending opportunity.
•	The target borrower base — rural households, small farmers, MSMEs, and semi-urban families — represents a chronically underserved segment that has historically relied on unorganized moneylenders and local pawnbrokers.
•	Market competition in silver loans will be significantly lower at launch than in the gold loan segment, where NBFCs like Muthoot and Manappuram dominate, offering a genuine first-mover window.
•	Operational challenges include silver's greater price volatility relative to gold (50% of global silver demand is industrial), higher storage costs due to the metal's lower value density, and the need for trained assayers familiar with silver purity standards (hallmarking at 92.5%).

Strategic Recommendation
We recommend that the NBFC pursue an early-launch strategy for Loan Against Silver, targeting Tier II and Tier III cities and rural markets across key silver-holding states such as Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, and Madhya Pradesh. A phased rollout beginning with pilot branches in Q1 FY2027 can be scaled rapidly using the NBFC's existing gold loan infrastructure, customer networks, and branch footprint. With the right product design, targeted outreach, and investment in silver assaying capacity, LAS can become a strategic pillar of the NBFC's retail secured lending portfolio within 3–5 years.
 MARKET OVERVIEW
2.1  The Silver Economy in India
India's relationship with silver spans millennia. As the world's largest consumer and importer of silver, India absorbed approximately 140–160 million ounces (roughly 4,000–4,500 tonnes) of silver annually in the years preceding 2025, primarily for jewellery, silverware, and ceremonial use. Unlike gold — which is associated with the urban middle class and elite households — silver occupies a unique socioeconomic position: it is the primary precious metal of India's rural poor, agricultural communities, and lower-income urban households.
According to Metals Focus, Indian households have accumulated an estimated 29,000 tonnes of silver jewellery alone since 2010, with an additional 4,000 tonnes held in coin form. Combined with older historical holdings, total household silver in India is estimated at between 33,000 and 65,000 tonnes depending on the survey methodology. Even at current silver prices (approximately ₹90,000–95,000 per kg as of early 2026), the lower-bound estimate of 33,000 tonnes represents a potential asset base worth approximately ₹300 lakh crore — a figure that dwarfs India's entire formal credit market.

KEY STAT	According to the Mint Survey 2025, Indians hold nearly 65,000 tonnes of silver — the vast majority sitting idle. Jewellers associations surveying 14 states found that silver jewellery accounts for approximately 60% of jewellers' revenues, underscoring silver's pervasive presence in the household economy.

2.2  Regulatory Catalyst: RBI Directions, 2025
The pivotal regulatory development driving the Loan Against Silver opportunity is the Reserve Bank of India (Lending Against Gold and Silver Collateral) Directions, 2025, notified on June 6, 2025, with an implementation deadline of April 1, 2026. This is the first time in India's post-independence financial history that silver has been formally recognized as loan collateral under a comprehensive, principle-based regulatory framework.
The Directions apply to all regulated entities including commercial banks, regional rural banks, co-operative banks, NBFCs, and housing finance companies (except payments banks). They replace prior ad hoc circulars and address systemic deficiencies that the RBI had identified in the gold loan market through penalty actions — including deviations in assaying, non-compliance with LTV limits, and opaque auction practices.

2.3  Regulatory Framework: Key Parameters

2.4  Market Size & Growth Potential
The silver loan market in India is, at the time of this report's publication, effectively nascent within the formal sector. While some local co-operative banks and small NBFCs have informally offered silver-backed lending, no standardized, large-scale product exists. This creates a unique market entry moment for well-capitalized, distribution-rich NBFCs with existing precious metal lending experience.
Drawing analogies with the gold loan market — which currently operates at approximately ₹7.1 lakh crore (2024) in the organized sector, representing barely 7% of the total potential — the silver loan market's total addressable opportunity can be computed as follows:

Metric	Gold Loan (Benchmark)	Silver Loan (Projection)
Household Metal Holdings	~27,000 tonnes	~33,000–65,000 tonnes
% Currently Monetized (Organised)	~7%	<1% (currently informal)
Estimated Asset Value (₹ Lakh Crore)	₹130 lakh crore	₹30–60 lakh crore (est.)
Addressable Market at 75% LTV	₹63 lakh crore (potential)	₹15–25 lakh crore (est. potential)
Current Organised Market Size	₹7.1 lakh crore	Nascent (sub-₹5,000 crore)
Projected Combined Market by 2028	—	₹1.45 lakh crore (RBI FSR 2025)

The RBI Financial Stability Report 2025 estimates that the combined gold and silver loan market could reach ₹1.45 lakh crore by 2028, with silver contribution growing rapidly from a near-zero baseline. Given the analogous trajectory of the gold loan market (which grew at 25% CAGR FY2020–FY2024), NBFCs that establish presence in FY2027 can reasonably project to build a ₹500–2,000 crore silver loan book within three years depending on branch coverage, awareness campaigns, and operational efficiency.

2.5  Demand Drivers
2.5.1  Rural Financial Inclusion Imperative
Approximately 63% of India's population resides in rural areas, with more than half of rural households dependent on agriculture. Access to formal credit has historically been limited for this demographic due to the lack of verifiable income, credit history, or acceptable collateral. Silver, however, is one asset class that is widely held even in the poorest rural households. The RBI's new framework directly addresses this gap by enabling credit without credit score requirements for loans up to ₹2.5 lakh — the precise ticket-size that rural and semi-urban borrowers require.
2.5.2  Rising Silver Prices
Silver prices have appreciated significantly in 2024–2025, driven by dual demand from the jewellery/investment sector and the clean energy industry (solar panels, EV batteries, and electronics require substantial silver). As silver prices rise, the collateral value per kilogram increases, enabling higher loan disbursals against the same pledged quantity. This is analogous to the gold price tailwind that helped the gold loan market grow 124% in gold loan volumes in June 2025 per RBI data.
2.5.3  Shift from Informal to Formal Lending
India's informal silver loan market — conducted through local pawnbrokers, sarrafas, and unregistered moneylenders — is estimated to be multiple times larger than the nascent formal segment. These lenders often charge exploitative interest rates, offer poor valuations, and provide no legal protections to borrowers. The RBI's formalization of silver loans, backed by its mandate for Key Fact Statements, standardized auction procedures, and consumer grievance frameworks, provides borrowers with strong incentives to shift to regulated lenders.
2.5.4  MSME and Agricultural Credit Demand
Small farmers and MSMEs represent India's most credit-starved segments. Agriculture contributes 16–18% of national output but struggles to access institutional credit, especially in the Kharif planting season. Silver loans can serve as seasonal working capital — a use case with immediate and proven demand. The RBI's Circular No. RBI/2025-26/09 further clarifies that small loans up to ₹2 lakh under agriculture or MSME heads can accept silver collateral without violating collateral-free norms, broadening the product's applicability.

2.6  Geographic Opportunity: High-Silver-Ownership States
Silver ownership in India is disproportionately concentrated in certain states, reflecting cultural, historical, and economic factors. A targeted geographic strategy is essential for LAS product launch.

State/Region	Silver Ownership Profile	Key Borrower Segment	Strategic Priority
Rajasthan	Among highest per capita silver holdings nationally; extensive tribal jewellery tradition	Agricultural, tribal, rural artisans	TIER 1 – Launch Priority
Uttar Pradesh	Large rural population, widespread use of silver in weddings and rituals	Farmers, MSMEs, rural households	TIER 1 – Launch Priority
Bihar & Jharkhand	High rural silver ownership; low formal credit penetration	Agricultural households, small traders	TIER 1 – Launch Priority
Odisha	Silver jewellery accounts for significant share of jeweller revenues	Tribal communities, farmers	TIER 1 – Launch Priority
Madhya Pradesh	Large rural hinterland with traditional silver usage	Rural households, artisans	TIER 2 – Phase 2
Maharashtra	Urban/semi-urban silver holdings; relatively better financial access	Small businesses, urban households	TIER 2 – Phase 2
West Bengal	Strong silver jewellery culture in rural districts	Farmers, rural artisans	TIER 2 – Phase 2
Tamil Nadu / Kerala	Historically gold-dominant; silver growing as complementary asset	Urban semi-formal, MSMEs	TIER 3 – Phase 3

2.7  Risks & Challenges
While the opportunity is substantial, a responsible market entry requires full acknowledgment of the risks inherent to the silver loan segment:
•	Price Volatility: Silver prices are significantly more volatile than gold prices due to industrial demand dynamics. Approximately 50% of global silver demand originates from the electronics, solar, and automotive sectors, making silver prices sensitive to industrial cycles. An NBFC must maintain conservative valuation protocols and robust LTV monitoring systems to protect against collateral value erosion.
•	Storage and Logistics Costs: Silver's lower value density (approximately 1/80th the value per gram compared to gold at current prices) means that storing 10 kg of silver requires physical space and insurance proportional to only a fraction of the equivalent gold loan. However, the absolute operational cost per loan may reduce profitability on small-ticket loans if not managed efficiently.
•	Assaying Infrastructure Gaps: Unlike gold, which has a well-established assaying and hallmarking ecosystem in India, silver's purity testing infrastructure is less mature. NBFCs will need to invest in silver-specific assaying equipment, training for branch staff, and partnerships with certified assayers.
•	Borrower Education: Many rural silver holders are unfamiliar with formal loan processes. Significant investment in borrower awareness, local-language outreach, and digital onboarding will be required to drive adoption.
•	Auction Risk: In the event of loan default, the silver auction process — though mandated by RBI to return any surplus to the borrower — adds operational complexity. Secondary market depth for silver in many Tier III geographies is lower than for gold.
 COMPETITIVE INSIGHTS
3.1  Competitive Landscape Assessment
The Loan Against Silver market, being a newly formalized product effective April 2026, presents a fundamentally different competitive landscape compared to the mature gold loan market. There are no established dominant players in silver lending at the institutional level as of the report date. This is a rare occurrence in Indian financial services — a regulated, large-opportunity product with no entrenched incumbents.
The competitive dynamics must be assessed across two dimensions: (a) lenders that will leverage existing precious-metal infrastructure to enter silver loans quickly, and (b) new entrants or aggressive NBFCs that may use silver loans as a differentiated positioning strategy.

3.2  Gold Loan NBFC Leaders — Likely First Movers
The NBFCs best positioned to rapidly launch silver loans are those with established gold loan operations, including branch networks, trained assayers, vault infrastructure, and rural customer bases. However, even these players will need to adapt their operations for silver's unique characteristics.

Institution	Type	Gold Loan AUM (Approx.)	Branch Count	Silver Loan Readiness	Key Advantage
Muthoot Finance	NBFC	₹90,000+ Crore	~5,000+	HIGH – First mover likely	Largest gold loan network, South India dominance
Manappuram Finance	NBFC	₹25,000+ Crore	~4,700+	HIGH – First mover likely	Tech-enabled, online gold loans, rural reach
IIFL Finance	NBFC	₹22,000+ Crore	~3,800+	MEDIUM-HIGH	Digital first, urban presence, diversified NBFC
SBI	Public Bank	Large Portfolio	22,000+ branches	MEDIUM – Compliance-driven rollout	Rural reach through Jan Dhan network
Federal Bank	Private Bank	~₹5,000 Crore	~1,300+	MEDIUM	Strong Kerala/South India presence
Bajaj Finance	NBFC	Moderate	~4,000+	MEDIUM – Diversified	Strong urban MSME reach
Fintech NBFCs (Rupeek, Oro, etc.)	Fintech NBFC	Growing	Asset-light	LOW-MEDIUM – Awaiting clarity	Digital native, doorstep model
Local/Regional NBFCs	Small NBFC	Small	Limited	LOW – Compliance lag	Deep rural penetration in specific geographies

3.3  Competitive Positioning Matrix
The silver loan competitive space can be mapped on two key dimensions: geographic reach (urban vs. rural) and operational readiness (high vs. low). The following matrix guides positioning strategy:

	HIGH OPERATIONAL READINESS	LOW OPERATIONAL READINESS
RURAL REACH	STRONGEST POSITION — Muthoot, Manappuram, SBI. Target of our NBFC strategy.	Local co-ops, small NBFCs — may lose market share to compliant players.
URBAN REACH	IIFL Finance, Bajaj Finance, Fintech NBFCs — urban silver loans; less priority near-term.	New private banks, late-moving NBFCs — will enter once market validates.

3.4  Competitive Differentiation Factors for NBFCs vs Banks
While banks command larger customer bases and lower cost of funds, NBFCs retain structural advantages in the silver loan market, particularly in the segments and geographies most relevant to this opportunity:

Factor	NBFC Advantage	Bank Advantage
Speed of Disbursal	Faster — same day or within hours	Often slower — more bureaucratic
Branch Flexibility	Can open sub-branches, business correspondents in rural areas	Restricted branch models
Credit Underwriting	Asset-based; no CIBIL score needed for small loans	Preference for salaried/documented income
Product Customization	Flexible tenors, bullet/EMI options, top-up facilities	Standardized products
Rural Outreach	Deep rural operations for gold loan NBFCs	Strong but not always last-mile
Interest Rate	Slightly higher than banks (typically 12–24% vs 8–14%)	Lower cost of funds advantage
Regulatory Compliance	Nimble adoption of new RBI frameworks	Slower systemic compliance
Technology Adoption	Fintech partnerships, app-based renewals, doorstep loans	Improving but often lagging

3.5  Analogous Competitive Dynamics: Gold Loan Lessons for Silver
The gold loan market's competitive history provides a powerful roadmap for anticipating silver loan dynamics. In the gold loan segment, specialized NBFCs such as Muthoot Finance and Manappuram Finance built dominant positions between 2005–2015 by investing early in branch infrastructure, local brand trust, and rapid disbursal. When banks subsequently attempted to enter aggressively, the specialized NBFCs retained their rural and sub-prime customer base despite slightly higher interest rates, because of trust, speed, and accessibility.
The silver loan market will likely follow a similar trajectory. NBFCs that build early brand presence and operational competence in silver assaying will develop defensible competitive moats before the market matures. Key differentiation strategies include:
•	Doorstep Silver Assessment: Partnering with mobile assaying teams to evaluate silver at the borrower's home, eliminating the need to transport bulky silver to branches.
•	Transparent Valuation: Publishing daily IBJA-linked silver rates on mobile apps and branch boards — building trust in an asset class historically associated with informal, opaque transactions.
•	Regional Language Marketing: Communication in Hindi, Rajasthani, Bhojpuri, Odia, and other regional languages targeting the primary silver-holding demographic.
•	Seasonal Loan Products: Pre-Kharif and Diwali season silver loans tailored to agricultural and festive credit cycles.
•	Bundled Products: Cross-selling crop insurance, micro-savings, and health microinsurance to silver loan borrowers — deepening relationship and improving unit economics.

3.6  Fintech Disruption in Silver Loans
While traditional NBFCs and banks are best positioned for immediate silver loan deployment (given the physical handling requirement), fintech companies are already exploring adjacent opportunities. Digital gold lenders such as Rupeek (acquired by Piramal Finance) have pioneered doorstep gold assessment and rapid disbursal models. These players are likely to extend their tech-enabled model to silver loans as the market matures. NBFCs should consider:
•	Technology Partnerships: Collaborating with fintech platforms for digital-KYC, borrower onboarding, and collateral tracking to reduce operational costs.
•	API-Based Silver Price Integration: Real-time IBJA pricing APIs integrated into branch systems and customer apps ensure compliance and build transparency.
•	Blockchain-Based Collateral Tracking: Emerging solutions for tamper-proof silver inventory records could reduce audit risk and improve investor confidence in silver loan AUM quality.

3.7  Competitive SWOT Analysis for India-Based Global NBFC

✔  STRENGTHS
• Existing gold loan/secured lending infrastructure reusable for silver
• Global NBFC brand — credibility in rural markets
• Strong capital base for rapid branch expansion
• Technology platform for compliant LTV monitoring
• Regulatory relationships for smooth RBI compliance	✖  WEAKNESSES
• Silver assaying expertise gaps — training investment needed
• Higher storage cost per ₹ of loan vs. gold
• Borrower awareness curve — product education required
• Limited silver secondary market depth in rural areas
• Initial product uncertainty around pricing and tenor
★  OPPORTUNITIES
• First-mover advantage in a ₹15–25 lakh crore potential market
• 33,000+ tonnes of untapped household silver as collateral pool
• Rural financial inclusion mandate aligned with government priorities
• Shift of informal silver lenders' customers to formal channel
• Cross-selling to existing gold loan customer base	⚠  THREATS
• Muthoot & Manappuram scaling silver ops rapidly using gold footprint
• Silver price volatility eroding collateral values rapidly
• RBI imposing further regulatory restrictions if NPA quality deteriorates
• Informal pawnbrokers retaining rural borrowers with simpler processes
• Bank entry with lower interest rates squeezing NBFC margins

3.8  Pricing & Interest Rate Landscape
While specific silver loan interest rates are yet to be standardized (given the product's nascency), competitive benchmarks from the gold loan market provide useful guidance. Gold loan interest rates in the organized sector range from 8–14% per annum for banks and 12–24% per annum for NBFCs. Silver loans, given higher volatility and storage costs, may price at a modest premium of 1–3% over comparable gold loan rates. Suggested pricing bands for the NBFC:
Loan Ticket Size	Suggested Interest Rate Band	Rationale
Up to ₹50,000	18–22% p.a.	High operational cost per loan; rural borrower risk
₹50,001 – ₹2.5 Lakh	15–18% p.a.	Core rural and agricultural borrower segment
₹2.5 Lakh – ₹5 Lakh	13–16% p.a.	MSME and semi-urban borrower; moderate risk
₹5 Lakh – ₹10 Lakh	12–15% p.a.	Higher credit quality; stronger repayment capacity

•	Silver Vault Partnerships: Partner with professional vault service providers (e.g., Brinks, SIS, or specialized regional vault operators) for secure, insured storage of pledged silver, with geographically distributed vaults to minimize logistics costs.
•	Real-Time Silver Price Integration: Deploy IBJA price feeds into core banking systems for automated LTV calculation and daily collateral monitoring, with automated alerts for LTV breach triggering.
•	Digital Onboarding for Rural Borrowers: Build vernacular language digital journeys on feature phones (USSD/SMS-based) alongside smartphone apps, ensuring last-mile digital accessibility.
•	Risk Framework: Establish a silver loan-specific credit policy covering single borrower limits, portfolio concentration limits, LTV breach procedures, insurance requirements, and periodic collateral audits.

4.3  Financial Projections (Indicative)
Metric	FY2027 (Pilot)	FY2028 (Scale)	FY2029 (Consolidate)
Silver Loan AUM (₹ Crore)	100–300	500–1,000	1,500–3,000
Number of Active Branches	50–100	300–500	800–1,200
Average Ticket Size (₹)	75,000	1,00,000	1,25,000
Number of Borrowers	13,000–40,000	50,000–1,00,000	1,20,000–2,40,000
Target NPA (%)	<2%	<2.5%	<3%
Estimated Yield on AUM	14–18%	14–17%	13–16%

4.4  Conclusion
The formalization of silver as loan collateral under the RBI Directions, 2025 represents one of the most significant structural opportunities in India's NBFC sector in the past decade. For an India-based global NBFC with strong operational foundations in secured lending, this is not merely a product extension — it is a strategic beachhead into India's largest underserved credit segment.
The silver loan market combines the cultural familiarity and accessibility of gold lending with significantly lower competition, broader geographic reach, and deeper financial inclusion impact. By moving decisively before incumbents consolidate their positions, and by investing in the operational infrastructure that this product uniquely demands, the NBFC can carve out a leadership position in a market that has the potential to deliver substantial and sustainable AUM growth over the next five to ten years.
The key success factors will be speed, trust, operational discipline, and the ability to serve the rural borrower in their language, at their doorstep, and on their terms. Done right, Loan Against Silver can be the NBFC's most important rural growth driver for the next decade.
