Last updated: 2026-02-23

Use this as a slide deck outline and video narration bullets. Keep each slide to 3–6 short lines for clarity.

---

Slide 1 — Title
- req-ease: Research → Requirements, built on Req-ease
- Turn research and documents into backlog-ready user stories
- Fast demo: brief → KB → story in under 5 minutes

---

Slide 2 — Landing the point (Message)
- Expansion of Req-ease: Req-ease + Research = req-ease
- Purpose: close the gap between discovery and development
- Net result: move from insight to groomed backlog, faster

---

Slide 3 — Problem we solve
- Discovery outputs are scattered and hard to reuse
- Teams spend too much time turning research into stories
- Lost traceability: who made the decision, and why?

---

Slide 4 — Our solution (one-liner)
- req-ease wraps Req-ease with a research agent, KB, and workspace collaboration
- Generates evidence-backed user stories with traceability to original research

---

Slide 5 — Key capabilities (headline)
- Workspaces, Chats, Files, Collaborators, Market Research
- Linked Knowledge Base (KB) and one-click story generation via Req-ease

---

Slide 6 — Workspaces
- Organize projects and research into named contexts
- Workspace-level KB, files, tasks, and team access
- Shareable workspace exports for stakeholders

---

Slide 7 — Chats & Command Palette
- Conversational research assistant (natural language prompts)
- Slash commands and quick actions for common flows
- Keep conversation history tied to a project and KB

---

Slide 8 — Files & Analysis
- Upload PDFs/Excel and request instant analysis
- Convert documents into structured research sections
- Link file-derived insights to KB entries and tasks

---

Slide 9 — Collaborators & Tasks
- Assign tasks from research sections with priority and deadlines
- Tasks live in the workspace backlog and progress panel
- Trace tasks back to source research for accountability

---

Slide 10 — Knowledge Base (KB)
- Save curated research sections as KB items with metadata
- Reuse KB entries to seed Req-ease story generation
- Searchable, shareable, and versioned knowledge

---

Slide 11 — Req-ease integration (how it adds value)
- Feed KB items or research sections into Req-ease
- Output: candidate user stories, acceptance criteria, priorities
- PO reviews and pushes approved stories into the backlog

---

Slide 12 — Demo flow (narration bullets)
- Step 1: Type or upload a brief (e.g., market sizing for X)
- Step 2: Review generated research sections; save important ones to KB
- Step 3: Select KB items and click “Generate User Stories” (Req-ease)
- Step 4: Curate story candidates and accept to backlog

---

Slide 13 — Example outcomes (customer-facing)
- "Reduced discovery-to-story time by 40%"
- "Created 3 vetted user stories from a 5-minute research job"
- "Maintained audit trail from insight → story → sprint"

---

Slide 14 — Target personas & value
- PMs: Faster discovery and better story inputs
- POs/Scrum Masters: Clear acceptance criteria, less rework
- Researchers: Reusable, searchable findings

---

Slide 15 — KPIs to measure success
- Research jobs per workspace / month
- Stories generated and converted to backlog
- Time-to-first-accepted-story
- KB entries created and reused

---

Slide 16 — Pricing & packaging (high-level)
- Starter: limited credits, 1 workspace
- Team: unlimited research, Req-ease exports, multi-workspace
- Enterprise: SSO, audit logs, private model hosting

---

Slide 17 — Go-to-market & launch highlights
- Beta: invite PM teams, collect qualitative feedback
- Public launch: webinars, case studies, integrations (Slack, Drive)
- Enterprise: pilots with compliance and SSO

---

Slide 18 — Video & narrator tips (30–90s sections)
- Start with the problem and one-line solution (10–15s)
- Show the demo flow quickly — brief to story (30–45s)
- Call out KPIs and outcomes (10–15s)
- Close with CTA: "Start a free research job" or "Request a demo"

---

Slide 19 — Sales snippets & CTAs
- "Research that writes your user stories."
- "From insight to backlog—faster."
- CTAs: "Start a free research job" / "See a demo"

---

Slide 20 — FAQ & common concerns (closing)
- Q: What if AI output is wrong? A: Human-in-the-loop editing + versioning
- Q: How does this fit with existing docs? A: Import connectors and KB ingestion
- Q: Is data secure? A: Enterprise-grade controls available

---

Slide 21 — Next steps for stakeholders
- Run a pilot: 3 beta customers, 30 days each
- Prepare 5 onboarding templates for fast activation
- Track initial KPIs and collect qualitative feedback

---

Notes
- Use each slide as a single visual in the deck; expand with screenshots for demos.
- For video, keep narration tight and use the demo flow as the core visual.
